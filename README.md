# Anomaly-detection-on-Motor-current-signature-analysis-

Motor current signature analysis can be described as a technique that helps in determining the induction motorâ€™s operating condition without disturbing production. In other words, it senses an electrical signal that has current components and identifies the faults in the initial stage. Therefore, it plays a pivotal role in preventing damage and diagnosing motor failure.

In this model I have implemented different algorithms like isolation forest, K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to detect anomalies for real-time current readings of a 3-phase AC motor and predict future anomalies
